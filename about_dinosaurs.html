                Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that dominated Earth for over 160 million years,
                from the Triassic period through the Jurassic and into the Cretaceous period

                        <p>
                            These magnificent creatures ranged from the size of small birds to massive sauropods like
                            <em>Brachiosaurus</em>, which could reach lengths of up to 85 feet and weigh as much as 80 tons.
                            Their adaptation to various environments allowed them to thrive across all continents

                        <p>
                            Dinosaurs are broadly classified into two groups based on their hip structure:
                            <strong>Saurischia</strong> (lizard-hipped) and <strong>Ornithischia</strong> (bird-hipped).
                            The Saurischia included both carnivorous theropods and herbivorous sauropods,
                            while Ornithischia comprised various plant-eating species

                        <p>
                            Though non-avian dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago, their legacy continues
                            through modern birds, which are considered living dinosaurs. Their fossils provide invaluable insights
                            into Earth's ancient ecosystems and the evolution of life

                            The discovery of fossils across the globe — from the deserts of Mongolia to the badlands of North America —
                            has revealed incredible details about how dinosaurs lived, evolved, and disappeared. Each new find helps
                            scientists piece together the puzzle of prehistoric life and Earth's changing environments
