                The plant life of the Mesozoic Era created lush, verdant landscapes that served as home and sustenance
                for the dinosaurs that roamed the Earth.

                        <p>
                            Ferns were abundant during the age of dinosaurs, creating dense understories in prehistoric forests.
                            Cycads — palm-like plants with thick trunks and crowns of large compound leaves — were a major food source
                            for many herbivorous dinosaurs.

                            Coniferous trees dominated many prehistoric landscapes, forming vast forests that provided shelter and food.
                            Ginkgo trees, which still exist today, were also widespread and offered nutritious leaves for browsing dinosaurs.

                        <p>
                            During the Cretaceous period, flowering plants (angiosperms) began to diversify rapidly,
                            transforming ecosystems and creating new ecological niches. This “Cretaceous Explosion” of plant diversity
                            changed the face of Earth forever.

                        <p>
                            These plants formed complex ecosystems that supported not only dinosaurs but also insects, early mammals,
                            and other creatures. The interaction between plants and animals drove evolutionary changes that shaped
                            life as we know it today.
